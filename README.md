Description:
This project analyzes similarity between newspapers based on retweet patterns using Twitter data from 2018 to 2022. It explores how newspapers' audience behaviors change over time and what that reveals about the structure and dynamics of media ecosystems, particularly in Italy.

Approach:
- Built a bipartite network of users and newspapers based on retweet activity.

- Projected the bipartite graph onto the newspaper layer to observe inter-newspaper relationships.

- Applied PCA as adimensionality reduction technique to reduce complexity and visualize node dynamics.

- Calculated and plotted Louvain modularity.
